# Summer Vacation Planning

Planning a trip to Japan for late summer. Researching destinations: Tokyo for the urban experience, Kyoto for traditional culture, and maybe Osaka for the food scene.

Budget considerations: flights around $800, accommodation $100/night, food $50/day. Looking into JR Pass for train travel between cities. Need to learn some basic Japanese phrases and research cultural etiquette.

Excited about trying authentic ramen, visiting temples, and experiencing the cherry blossom season if timing works out.
