# Learning TypeScript

Today I started learning TypeScript for my React project. I'm building a web application that will help users track their fitness goals and nutrition habits. The app will use a Node.js backend with Express and connect to a PostgreSQL database.

I also practiced some mindfulness meditation this morning and did some journaling about my career goals in software development.
