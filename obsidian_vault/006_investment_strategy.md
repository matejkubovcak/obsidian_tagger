# Investment Portfolio Review

Reviewed my investment portfolio today and rebalanced the allocation. Currently holding 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% cryptocurrency. The tech sector has been performing well, especially my holdings in AI and cloud computing companies.

Need to research more about ESG investing and consider adding some sustainable energy ETFs. Also thinking about increasing my emergency fund to 6 months of expenses before making any major investment moves.
