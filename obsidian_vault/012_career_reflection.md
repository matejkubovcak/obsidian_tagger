# Career Development Thoughts

Been reflecting on my career path and future goals. Currently working as a software engineer, but interested in moving toward machine learning and AI roles. The field is evolving rapidly with new developments in deep learning and natural language processing.

Planning to take some online courses in TensorFlow and PyTorch. Also considering pursuing a master's degree in data science part-time. Need to update my LinkedIn profile and start networking more in the ML community.

Long-term goal: work on AI products that have positive social impact.
