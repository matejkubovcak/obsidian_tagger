# Photography Session Downtown

Took my camera downtown for a street photography session. Focused on capturing candid moments and interesting architecture. The golden hour lighting was perfect for portraits and urban landscapes.

Experimented with different aperture settings and learned more about depth of field. Shot in RAW format for better post-processing flexibility. Planning to edit the photos in Lightroom this evening and maybe share some on Instagram.

Photography is becoming a serious hobby - considering taking a workshop to improve my composition skills.
