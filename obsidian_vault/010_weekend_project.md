# Weekend DIY Project

Spent the weekend building a standing desk for my home office. Used reclaimed wood and adjustable metal legs ordered online. The project took longer than expected due to some measuring mistakes, but it turned out great.

Tools used: circular saw, drill, sandpaper, wood stain. Total cost was about $150, much cheaper than buying a similar desk. The process was therapeutic and gave me a sense of accomplishment. Thinking about building some floating shelves next.
