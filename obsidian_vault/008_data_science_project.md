# Data Science Side Project

Working on a personal data science project to analyze my sleep patterns and productivity levels. Using Python with pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

The dataset includes sleep duration, wake-up times, caffeine intake, and daily productivity scores. Initial analysis shows a strong correlation between sleep quality and next-day performance. Planning to build a predictive model using scikit-learn to forecast optimal bedtimes.
