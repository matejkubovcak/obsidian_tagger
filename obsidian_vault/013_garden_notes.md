# Garden Progress Update

The tomato plants are thriving after the recent rain. Already seeing small green tomatoes forming. The basil and herbs are growing well too - been using fresh basil in my cooking almost daily.

Had some issues with aphids on the roses, but the ladybugs are keeping them in check naturally. Planted some marigolds as companion plants to deter pests. The vegetable garden is requiring more water than expected during this hot spell.

Planning to start composting kitchen scraps to improve soil quality for next season.
