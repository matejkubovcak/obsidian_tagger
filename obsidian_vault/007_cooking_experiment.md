# Trying New Recipes

Experimented with making homemade pasta today. Used a simple recipe with flour, eggs, and olive oil. The dough was tricky to work with at first, but after some practice, I managed to create decent fettuccine.

Paired it with a garlic and herb sauce made from scratch. The whole process was meditative and reminded me why I enjoy cooking. Planning to try making bread next weekend and maybe explore some Asian cuisine recipes.
