# Morning Workout Routine

Started the day with a 5K run around the neighborhood. The weather was perfect - cool morning air and clear skies. After the run, I did 30 minutes of strength training focusing on core exercises and push-ups.

I've been tracking my progress in a fitness app and noticed significant improvements in my endurance over the past month. Planning to add yoga sessions twice a week to improve flexibility and mindfulness.
